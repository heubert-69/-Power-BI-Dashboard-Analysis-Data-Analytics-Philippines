# -Power-BI-Dashboard-Analysis-Data-Analytics-Philippines
Welcome to my entry for the Emerson x DAPH National Data Challenge hosted by Data Analytics Philippines (DAP). This project demonstrates my ability to turn raw manufacturing data into clear, concise, and actionable insights using Power BI.  "A dashboard should communicate insights clearly. As Coach Abs says, don't make the client guess."

🔍 Key Insights (Not Directly Visualized in the Dashboard)
Total Batches Produced: 38

Overall Efficiency: 64%

Total Runtime: 41.17 hours

Total Downtime: 23.13 hours → 36% of total time

⚙️ Major Downtime Contributors
Machine Adjustment: 5.53 hrs

Machine Failure: 4.23 hrs

Inventory Shortage: 3.75 hrs

These top three causes contributed to 18.6 hours of downtime, potentially resulting in 17 missed batches.

👷 Operator Insights
Charlie and Dee had the most batches produced (11 each), but Charlie had the highest operator-related downtime (3.8 hrs).

Dennis had the lowest downtime (2.73 hrs) but a slightly lower efficiency (63%).

Mac had both low efficiency (61%) and high downtime (3.2 hrs).

📦 Product-Wise Batch Loss
CO-600 was the top product in terms of production (15 batches) but also had the most downtime-related batch loss (8 batches).

56% of the total downtime (12.93 hrs) was due to operator error, representing an opportunity to recover up to 11 batches.

🛠️ Tools Used
Power BI – for dashboard creation and visualization

Microsoft Excel – for preliminary data cleaning

Data Storytelling – for deriving and presenting insights clearly
